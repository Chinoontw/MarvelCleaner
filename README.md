## Experimental Tab

The Experimental tab is currently not recommended for use.  
It is for private testing only. No instructions or support will be provided until it is confirmed stable and safe.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an "Access Denied" error during cleaning:
- Run the program as Administrator (right-click > Run as administrator)  
- Ensure related folders are closed and not in use  
- Temporarily disable your antivirus if it blocks file deletion

## Setup

No installation is required. You can run the `.exe` or `.py` file directly.  
All settings are saved in `settings.json`.
